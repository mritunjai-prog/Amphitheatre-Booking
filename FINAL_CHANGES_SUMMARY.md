## 🎨 Color Legend

When you open the application, you'll see:

- 🟣 **Purple gradient** = VIP seats (very important persons)
- 🟠 **Orange/Gold gradient** = Guest seats (invited visitors)
- 🔵 **Blue gradient** = Faculty seats (professors, teachers)
- 🩷 **Pink gradient** = Parents seats (NEW category!)
- 🟢 **Green gradient** = Degree Students (final year, postgrad)
- 🔵 **Cyan gradient** = College Students (undergrad)
- 🔴 **Red/Rose gradient** = Booked/Assigned seats

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. ✅ `src/types/index.ts` - Added "Parents" to User and Seat category types
2. ✅ `src/utils/index.ts` - Updated seat generation logic
   - Limited Faculty to exactly 65 seats
   - Added Parents counter (135 seats)
   - Parents start immediately after Faculty in Row 5
   - Removed all General seat generation
   - Changed total rows from 29 to 23
3. ✅ `src/components/Seat.tsx` - Added pink gradient for Parents seats
4. ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Added "Parents: 0" to category summary and updated color legend
5. ✅ `SEATING_ALLOCATION_UPDATE.md` - Updated documentation

### Key Logic Changes:

```typescript
// Faculty: Exactly 65 seats
const maxFaculty = 65;
if (row >= 3 && row <= 5 && facultyCounter <= maxFaculty) {
  seatNumber = `F${facultyCounter++}`;
  category = "Faculty";
}

// Parents: Start immediately after Faculty, total 135 seats
const maxParents = 135;
else if (row >= 5 && row <= 7 && parentsCounter <= maxParents) {
  seatNumber = `P${parentsCounter++}`;
  category = "Parents";
}

// Loop only goes to row 23 (not 29)
for (let row = 1; row <= 23; row++) {
```

## ✨ What This Means

### Before:

- 1,450 total seats (29 rows)
- Faculty: 150 seats (F1-F150)
- No Parents category
- General seats filling rows 24-29
- Seat numbers like G-24-1 existed

### After:

- **1,050 total seats (23 rows)** ⬇️ Reduced by 400
- **Faculty: 65 seats (F1-F65)** ⬇️ Reduced by 85
- **Parents: 135 seats (P1-P135)** ⭐ NEW CATEGORY
- **No General seats** ❌ Removed completely
- **All seats are category-specific** ✅

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the app**: Visit http://localhost:3000/
2. **Add Parents to users.csv**:
   ```csv
   id,name,email,phone,category
   10,John Parent,john@email.com,+91-1234567890,Parents
   ```
3. **Assign Parents**: Click any pink seat (P1-P135) and select a parent from the dropdown
4. **Save**: Click "💾 Save to CSV" button to download updated bookings
5. **Verify**: Faculty ends at F65, Parents start immediately after in same row

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Space Optimization**: Removed 400 unused general seats
2. **Clear Categories**: Every seat has a specific purpose
3. **Seamless Flow**: Faculty → Parents transition in same row
4. **Realistic Sizing**:
   - 65 faculty seats (typical department size)
   - 135 parent seats (adequate for events)
   - 600 college students (majority of audience)
5. **Easy Management**: Fewer rows = easier to navigate and manage

## 📱 Server Status
