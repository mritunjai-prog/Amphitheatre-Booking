# Row 27 Removal - Maximum 26 Rows

## ‚úÖ Change Applied: Row 27 Removed

### What Changed:

- **Maximum rows**: Limited to **26 rows** (row 27 no longer generated)
- **Row count**: Now goes from Row 1 to Row 26 only
- **Seat allocation**: All 600 College Students fit within rows 14-26

---

## üîß Technical Change

### Code Modification:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
const totalRows = lastStudentRow; // Could be 27 or more

// AFTER:
const totalRows = Math.min(lastStudentRow, 26); // Limit to row 26 max
```

### Effect:

- The seat generation loop now stops at row 26
- Row 27 will not be generated even if there's calculated capacity for it
- All seat limits (Faculty: 65, Parents: 100, College: 600) still enforced
