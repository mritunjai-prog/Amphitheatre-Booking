**Total Seats**: 1,050 (down from 1,450)

## Color Legend

The system uses color-coding to help identify seat categories at a glance:

- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: VIP seats (very important guests)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange/Gold**: Guest seats (invited visitors)
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Faculty seats (professors, teachers)
- ðŸ©· **Pink**: Parents seats (NEW - parents of students)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Degree Students (final year, postgraduate)
- ðŸ”µ **Cyan/Teal**: College Students (undergraduate students)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Emerald**: General/Available seats (anyone can book)
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Booked/Assigned seats (already taken)

## User Category Assignment

When adding users to the system, use these categories:

1. **VIP** - Chief guests, dignitaries, special invitees
2. **Guests** - External guests, alumni, special visitors
3. **Faculty** - Professors, teachers, academic staff
4. **Parents** - Parents of students attending the event
5. **Degree Students** - Final year, postgraduate students
6. **College Students** - Undergraduate, regular students

## How This Affects Seat Assignment

- **Parents** can now only be assigned to seats marked P1-P135
- **Faculty** assignments are limited to F1-F65 (reduced from F1-F150)
- **College Students** can only book seats 1-600 (reduced from 1-1000)
- All other categories remain the same
- **General seats** (350) can accommodate overflow from any category

## Data File Updates

After making these changes, you'll need to update your CSV files:

### users.csv

Add "Parents" as a new category option:

```csv
id,name,email,phone,category
10,John Parent,john.parent@email.com,+91-9876543219,Parents
```

### booked_seats.csv

Use the new seat numbers for Parents:

```csv
category,seatNumber,userId,userName,email,phone,notes
Parents,P1,10,John Parent,john.parent@email.com,+91-9876543219,Student Parent
```

## Benefits of This Layout

1. **Dedicated Parents Section**: Parents now have their own designated area (135 seats)
2. **Seamless Transition**: Faculty (F65) flows directly into Parents (P1) in the same row
3. **Balanced Distribution**: More realistic allocation based on typical event attendance
4. **No Wasted Space**: Removed general seats - all 1,050 seats are category-specific
5. **Compact Layout**: 23 rows instead of 29, easier to manage and view
6. **Practical Sizing**:
   - Faculty: 65 seats (realistic size)
   - Parents: 135 seats (adequate space)
   - Students: 800 total (600 college + 200 degree)

## Next Steps

1. **Update user data**: Add parents to users.csv with category "Parents"
2. **Clear old bookings**: Remove any old faculty bookings beyond F65
3. **Test assignments**: Verify that parent assignments work correctly
4. **Update documentation**: Share this guide with event coordinators
5. **Train staff**: Ensure everyone knows about the new Parents category
