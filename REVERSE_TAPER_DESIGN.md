# Reverse Tapered Seating - Widest at Back

## 🎭 Updated Design: Inverted Pyramid Layout

The seating now features a **reverse tapered design** where rows are **widest at the back** (furthest from stage) and get **progressively narrower** as they approach the Degree Students section.

---

## 📐 NEW Tapering Formula (REVERSED)

### Full-Width Rows (Rows 1-7):

- **50 seats per row** (25 left + 25 right)
- Categories: VIP, Guests, Faculty, Parents
- NO tapering

### Reverse Tapered Rows (Rows 8+):

- **LAST ROW (furthest back)** = **50 seats** (WIDEST)
- **Every 2 rows going UP**, remove **1 seat from each side** (2 total)
- **Direction**: Narrower towards the front (Degree Students area)

### Calculation (from BACK to FRONT):

```
Last Row (back):    50 seats ████████████████████████ (WIDEST)
2 rows before:      48 seats  ██████████████████████
2 rows before:      46 seats    ████████████████████
2 rows before:      44 seats      ██████████████████
2 rows before:      42 seats        ████████████████
2 rows before:      40 seats          ██████████████
2 rows before:      38 seats            ████████████
... continues narrowing towards Degree Students ...
First Row (Row 8):  ~30-40 seats       (NARROWEST in student section)
```

## ✨ Why This Design Makes Sense

### 1. **Better for Last Rows**

- Back rows (furthest from stage) get more seats
- Maximizes capacity where space is available
- People in back rows need less precision for viewing

### 2. **Premium Front Experience**

- Degree Students (closer to stage) get narrower, more focused rows
- Creates "premium" feeling for front sections
- Better sightlines for students closer to stage

### 3. **Natural Flow**

- Entrance is wide (more people can enter easily)
- Narrows as you approach stage (more intimate)
- Inverted pyramid shape

### 4. **Practical Benefits**

- Easier crowd management (wide entrance area)
- More seats where acoustics are challenging (back)
- Focused attention area near stage

## 🔢 Updated Tapering Pattern

### OLD (Wrong Direction):

```
Row 8:  50 seats (wide) ← Started here
Row 10: 46 seats
Row 12: 42 seats
Row 14: 38 seats
... getting narrower going BACK ❌
```

### NEW (Correct Direction):

```
Row 8:  ~38 seats (narrow) ← Starting narrower
Row 10: ~40 seats
Row 12: ~42 seats
Row 14: ~44 seats
...
Last Row: 50 seats (wide) ← Ending widest ✅
```

## 📊 Seat Count

| Category             | Seats        | Tapering                      |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| VIP                  | 50           | No (full width)               |
| Guests               | 50           | No (full width)               |
| Faculty              | 65           | No (full width)               |
| Parents              | 100          | No (full width)               |
| **Degree Students**  | **200**      | **Yes (narrower near stage)** |
| **College Students** | **~550-600** | **Yes (wider at back)**       |

## 🎯 Key Changes

1. **Direction Reversed**: Widest at back, narrower at front (student sections only)
2. **Reduction Rate**: Changed from -2 per side to -1 per side (gentler slope)
3. **Every 2 Rows**: Reduction happens every 2 rows (not every row)
4. **Maintains 200**: Degree Students still exactly 200 seats
5. **Better Symmetry**: Smoother, more gradual tapering

---

## 🖥️ Code Changes

### New Logic:

```typescript
// Calculate from the BACK (last row = widest)
const rowsFromBack = lastStudentRow - row; // 0 for last row
const reductionPairs = Math.floor(rowsFromBack / 2);
const seatsRemoved = reductionPairs * 2; // 1 from EACH side
return Math.max(50 - seatsRemoved, 10);
```

### What This Means:

- **Last row** (rowsFromBack = 0): 50 - 0 = **50 seats** ✅
- **2 rows before** (rowsFromBack = 2): 50 - 2 = **48 seats** ✅
- **4 rows before** (rowsFromBack = 4): 50 - 4 = **46 seats** ✅
- Continues narrowing towards Row 8...

**Implementation Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Design Type**: Reverse tapered (inverted pyramid)  
**Reduction Rate**: 1 seat per side every 2 rows  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and ready to test
