## Key Features

### 1. Symmetry Maintained

- **Degree & Parents Sections**: V-shape tapering (narrower at front, wider at back)
- **Tapering Pattern**: Reduce 2 seats (1 per side) every 2 rows going forward from row 21
- **Left/Right Balance**: Equal distribution with middle seat assigned to left section

### 2. College Section Strategy

- **NO TAPERING**: All rows have 50 seats (maximum width)
- **Reasoning**: Ensures reaching 400 college seats capacity
- **Rows 22-29**: All full width (50 seats per row)
- **Result**: 8 full rows give exactly 400 seats (with partial row 21)

### 3. Row 6 Removal

- Completely removed from generation
- `getSeatsPerRow(6)` returns 0
- No seats created for row 6
- Preserves row numbering (7 comes after 5)

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

1. **src/utils/index.ts**

   - `getSeatsPerRow()`: Returns actual seat counts per row
     - Rows 1-5: Fixed counts (32, 28, 28, 30, 30)
     - Row 6: Returns 0 (removed)
     - Rows 7-21: V-shape tapering formula
     - Rows 22-29: Fixed 50 seats (no tapering)
   - `maxGuests`: 56 (was 100)
   - `maxFaculty`: 60 (was 100)
   - `maxParents`: 368 (was 50)
   - `maxStudents`: 400 (was 650)

2. **scripts/verifySeatLayout.js**
   - Validation script confirms all totals
   - Checks symmetry pattern
   - Verifies no tapering in college section

### Tapering Formula (Rows 7-21)

```javascript
// Base: Row 21 = 46 seats
// Going forward: Remove 2 seats every 2 rows
const rowsFromBack = 21 - row;
const reductionPairs = Math.floor(rowsFromBack / 2);
const seatsRemoved = reductionPairs * 2;
const calculatedSeats = 46 - seatsRemoved;
```

### College Section (Rows 22-29)

```javascript
// NO TAPERING - all 50 seats
if (row >= 22) return 50;
```
