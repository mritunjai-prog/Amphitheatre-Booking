# Tapered Seating Layout - Stadium Style

## 🎭 New Design: Amphitheater with Narrowing Rows

The seating now features a **stadium-style tapered design** where rows get progressively narrower as they move away from the stage, creating better sightlines and a more intimate atmosphere.

---

## 📐 Tapering Formula

### Full-Width Rows (Rows 1-7):

- **50 seats per row** (25 left + 25 right)
- Categories: VIP, Guests, Faculty, Parents

### Tapered Rows (Rows 8+):

- **Every 2 rows**, remove **2 seats from each side** (4 total)
- Applies to: Degree Students and College Students

### Calculation:

```
Row 8-9:   50 seats (no reduction yet)
Row 10-11: 46 seats (reduced by 4)
Row 12-13: 42 seats (reduced by 8)
Row 14-15: 38 seats (reduced by 12)
Row 16-17: 34 seats (reduced by 16)
Row 18-19: 30 seats (reduced by 20)
Row 20-21: 26 seats (reduced by 24)
Row 22-23: 22 seats (reduced by 28)
Row 24-25: 18 seats (reduced by 32)
... continues until minimum width
```

## 📊 Actual Seat Distribution

### Fixed Categories (Full Width):

| Category    | Rows | Seats Per Row | Total Seats |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **VIP**     | 1    | 50            | 50          |
| **Guests**  | 2    | 50            | 50          |
| **Faculty** | 3-5  | 50            | 65          |
| **Parents** | 5-7  | 50            | 100         |

### Tapered Categories:

| Category             | Estimated Rows | Tapering | Total Seats |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| **Degree Students**  | 8-11 (~4 rows) | Yes      | 200         |
| **College Students** | 12+            | Yes      | ~550-600    |

## ✨ Benefits of Tapered Design

### 1. **Better Sightlines**

- Back rows are narrower, ensuring everyone can see the stage
- Reduces "blind spots" from people in front
- Creates more intimate viewing experience

### 2. **Acoustic Advantages**

- Sound reflects better in a tapered space
- Better audience engagement from back rows
- Professional amphitheater design

### 3. **Visual Symmetry**

- Creates elegant V-shape or funnel appearance
- Looks more professional and intentional
- Front-heavy design keeps VIPs prominent

### 4. **Space Efficiency**

- Uses space where it matters most (front rows)
- Reduces wasted seating in far back rows
- Maintains 200 Degree Students (exact requirement)

---

## 🔢 Technical Implementation

### Code Logic:

```typescript
const getSeatsPerRow = (row: number): number => {
  if (row <= 7) {
    return 50; // Full width for VIP, Guests, Faculty, Parents
  } else if (row >= 8) {
    const studentRow = row - 8; // 0-indexed from row 8
    const reductionPairs = Math.floor(studentRow / 2);
    const seatsRemoved = reductionPairs * 4;
    return Math.max(50 - seatsRemoved, 10); // Minimum 10 seats
  }
  return 50;
};
```

### Key Features:

- ✅ Rows 1-7: Full 50-seat width
- ✅ Row 8+: Progressive tapering
- ✅ Every 2 rows: Remove 4 seats total (2 per side)
- ✅ Minimum width: 10 seats (safety limit)
- ✅ Dynamic row calculation (adds rows as needed)
- ✅ Maintains exactly 200 Degree Students

## 📱 User Interface Updates

### What You'll See:

1. **Rows dynamically adjust** to show correct number
2. **Narrower rows** visually centered
3. **Symmetrical appearance** with proper spacing
4. **Seat numbers** remain sequential (D1-D200, 1-600)
5. **Color coding** unchanged (pink, green, cyan, etc.)

### In the Application:

- Open http://localhost:3000/
- Scroll down to see the tapered effect
- Notice rows getting narrower starting from Row 10
- Perfect symmetry on left/right sections
