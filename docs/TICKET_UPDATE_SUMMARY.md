**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Update Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: ✅ Complete & Production Ready

---

## 📋 What Changed

### 1. **Ticket Naming Convention** 🏷️

**Previous Format:**

```
ticket_D1_123.pdf
ticket_381_456.pdf
```

**New Format:**

```
ticket_D1.pdf    ← Degree Student, Seat D1
ticket_C1.pdf    ← College Student, Seat 1
```

#### Naming Pattern by Category:

| Category           | Prefix | Example                              | Count |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Degree Students    | `D`    | `ticket_D1.pdf` to `ticket_D175.pdf` | 175   |
| College Students   | `C`    | `ticket_C1.pdf` to `ticket_C381.pdf` | 381   |
| Faculty _(future)_ | `F`    | `ticket_F1.pdf`, `ticket_F2.pdf`     | -     |
| VIP _(future)_     | `V`    | `ticket_V1.pdf`, `ticket_V2.pdf`     | -     |
| Guests _(future)_  | `G`    | `ticket_G1.pdf`, `ticket_G2.pdf`     | -     |
| Parents _(future)_ | `P`    | `ticket_P1.pdf`, `ticket_P2.pdf`     | -     |

### 2. **Email Privacy Update** 🔒

**Degree Student Tickets:**

- ✅ Guest Name
- ❌ **Email (REMOVED)** ← Privacy protection
- ✅ Contact (Phone)
- ✅ Category
- ✅ Notes (Degree type)

**College Student Tickets:**

- ✅ Guest Name
- ✅ **Email (RETAINED)** ← Contact information
- ✅ Contact (Phone)
- ✅ Category

**Rationale:**

- Degree-awarding students receive official degrees - enhanced privacy
- College students are general attendees - contact info helpful for communication
- Future categories (Faculty, VIP) will have email based on need
