## Chapter 7: Complete Event Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (1-2 Weeks Before)

**Collect attendee information:**

- Create your list in Excel or get it from registration forms
- For students: Process consent forms (check "NEW CONSENT FORM.csv")
- Organize by category

**Enter attendees into the system:**

- Use "View CSV Data" â†’ Attendees tab
- Add all names, contacts, categories
- For students, include enrollment numbers
- Save the data

**Review seat totals:**

Check if you have enough seats per category:

| Category         | Available | Currently Used | Remaining |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| VIP              | 50        | 0              | 50        |

## Chapter 8: Understanding the Data (Simple Explanation)

### Where Information is Stored

The system uses two simple lists (like Excel spreadsheets):

#### 1. Attendees List (users.csv)

Contains everyone who might attend:

- ID
- Seat Number
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Category

Think of this as your "phone book" â€” everyone you might seat.

**Current Status:**

- Total entries: 570
- Degree students: 175
- College students: 395

#### 2. Bookings List (booked_seats.csv)

Contains actual seat assignments:

- Category
- Seat number
- User ID
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Special notes (enrollment number, branch, etc.)

Think of this as your "seating chart" â€” who sits where.

**Current Status:**

- Total bookings: 570
- Last updated: October 23, 2025

### How They Work Together

1. First, you add people to the Attendees List
2. Then you assign them seats (creates entries in Bookings List)
3. The visual map reads the Bookings List and colors seats accordingly
4. When you export, you get data from both lists combined
5. Ticket generation reads from both lists to create PDF tickets

### Editing the Lists Directly

You can edit these lists like a spreadsheet:

1. Click "View CSV Data"
2. Make changes directly in the tables
3. Save when done
4. The map updates automatically
5. Regenerate tickets if needed

## Chapter 9: Processing New Student Registrations

### Using the Consent Form Processor

When you receive new student consent forms:

**Step 1: Prepare the data**

- Save the consent form responses as "NEW CONSENT FORM.csv" in the data/ folder
- Ensure it has required columns: Name, Enrollment Number, Email, Contact, etc.

**Step 2: Process the form**

1. Run: `node scripts/processConsentForm.js`
2. The script will:
   - Check against existing degree students (removes duplicates)
   - Filter out students who said "No" to attending
   - Assign sequential seat numbers
   - Update booked_seats.csv and users.csv

**Step 3: Check for duplicates**

1. Run: `node scripts/checkDuplicates.js`
2. Review the duplicate report
3. If duplicates found, run: `node scripts/fixDuplicates.js`

**Step 4: Regenerate tickets**

1. Run: `node scripts/generateTickets.js`
2. New tickets will be created for new students
3. Existing tickets remain unchanged

**Example Results (from October 23, 2025):**

- Total responses: 444
- Not attending: 3
- Duplicates with degree students: 45
- Duplicates within college students: 378
- **New unique students added: 14**
- Final total: 570 unique students

---

## Chapter 10: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Duplicate Students

**Problem:** Same student appears multiple times

**Solution:**

1. Run `node scripts/checkDuplicates.js` to identify duplicates
2. Run `node scripts/fixDuplicates.js` to remove them automatically
3. Regenerate tickets

### Issue 2: Seat Capacity Exceeded

**Problem:** More students than available seats

**Current Capacity:**

- Degree Students: 210 seats (175 used, 35 free)
- College Students: 578 seats (395 used, 183 free)

**Solution:**

- Prioritize confirmed attendees
- Use waiting list for overflow
- Consider expanding to other categories if needed

### Issue 3: Missing Logo on Tickets

**Problem:** Logo doesn't appear on generated tickets

**Solution:**

1. Verify `image/logo.png` exists
2. Check file is not corrupted
3. Regenerate tickets: `node scripts/generateTickets.js`

### Issue 4: Wrong Date on Tickets

**Current Date:** October 28, 2025

**Solution:**

- Check `scripts/generateTickets.js` line with date
- Should read: "Date: 28th October, 2025"
- Regenerate if incorrect
