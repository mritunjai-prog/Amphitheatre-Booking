## ✅ All Issues Fixed and Tickets Regenerated!

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Complete - 556 tickets regenerated successfully

---

## 🛠️ Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Section Assignment Corrected**

**Problem:** Sections were showing as "Center" instead of "Left" or "Right"

**Solution:** Implemented proper left/right section logic based on actual seating layout
- Seats in first half of each row → **Left Section**
- Seats in second half of each row → **Right Section**
- Accurate row-by-row mapping for all 25 rows

**Example:**
- Seat D1-D23 (Row 7) → **Left Section**
- Seat D24-D46 (Row 7) → **Right Section**
- Seat 1-21 (Row 13) → **Left Section**
- Seat 22-42 (Row 13) → **Right Section**

### 2. ✅ **Extra Page Removed**

**Problem:** Tickets had 2 pages with content overflow

**Solution:** 
- Optimized layout spacing
- Fixed absolute positioning for footer
- Ensured all content fits on single page (600x800px)
- Instructions positioned carefully to avoid page break

### 3. ✅ **Time Updated**

**Problem:** Time was showing 10:00 AM

**Solution:** Updated to **4:30 PM** everywhere:
- PDF ticket header
- Email HTML template
- Email plain text version
