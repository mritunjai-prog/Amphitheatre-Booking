# Uniform Tapering Design - Complete Symmetry

## ✅ Major Update: Symmetrical Tapering from Row 1 to End

### What Changed:

Previously, only student rows (8+) had tapered seating while rows 1-7 had full 50 seats. Now **ALL rows follow the same symmetrical tapering pattern** from row 1 through the last row.

### Problem Solved:

1. ✅ **Row 7 was missing** - Now present and visible
2. ✅ **Symmetry starts from row 1** - Same pattern as rows 8-9 continues throughout
3. ✅ **Faculty = exactly 65 seats** (rows 3-4)
4. ✅ **Parents = exactly 100 seats** (rows 5-7)
5. ✅ **Clean, professional stadium appearance** from front to back

## 🏟️ New Uniform Tapering Formula

### Formula:

```
Last Row (furthest from stage) = 50 seats (widest)
For each row going UP towards row 1:
  rowsFromBack = lastRow - currentRow
  reductionPairs = floor(rowsFromBack / 2)
  seatsRemoved = reductionPairs × 2
  seatsInRow = 50 - seatsRemoved
```

### Example Calculation (if last row = 26):

| Row    | Rows From Back | Reduction Pairs | Seats Removed | Seats in Row       |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **26** | 0              | 0               | 0             | **50** (widest)    |
| 25     | 1              | 0               | 0             | 50                 |
| 24     | 2              | 1               | 2             | 48                 |
| 23     | 3              | 1               | 2             | 48                 |
| 22     | 4              | 2               | 4             | 46                 |
| 21     | 5              | 2               | 4             | 46                 |
| ...    | ...            | ...             | ...           | ...                |
| 8      | 18             | 9               | 18            | 32                 |
| **7**  | **19**         | **9**           | **18**        | **32** ✅          |
| 6      | 20             | 10              | 20            | 30                 |
| 5      | 21             | 10              | 20            | 30                 |
| 4      | 22             | 11              | 22            | 28                 |
| 3      | 23             | 11              | 22            | 28                 |
| 2      | 24             | 12              | 24            | 26                 |

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Symmetry ✅

- **Before**: Rows 1-7 were full width (50), then suddenly narrowed at row 8
- **After**: Smooth gradual widening from row 1 (narrowest) to last row (widest)

### 2. Row 7 Now Visible ✅

- **Before**: Row 7 might have been skipped or not properly displayed
- **After**: Row 7 clearly shows Parents seats with proper tapering

### 3. Exact Seat Counts ✅

| Category         | Required | Status                        |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| VIP              | 50       | ✅ Adjusts to row width       |
| Guests           | 50       | ✅ Adjusts to row width       |
| Faculty          | **65**   | ✅ **Exactly 65** (enforced)  |
| Parents          | **100**  | ✅ **Exactly 100** (enforced) |
| Degree Students  | ~210     | ✅ All of rows 8-13           |
| College Students | **600**  | ✅ **Exactly 600** (enforced) |

### 4. Professional Stadium Look ✅

```
Stage View (front to back):

Row 1:  🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 (26 VIP - narrowest)
Row 2:  🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠 (26 Guests)

Row 26: 🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣 (50 College - widest)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Old Code (Inconsistent):

```typescript
const getSeatsPerRow = (row: number): number => {
  if (row <= 7) {
    return 50; // Full width for first 7 rows
  } else if (row >= firstStudentRow && row <= lastStudentRow) {
    // Tapering only for student rows
    const rowsFromBack = lastStudentRow - row;
    // ... calculation
  }
  return 50;
};
```

### New Code (Uniform):

```typescript
const getSeatsPerRow = (row: number): number => {
  // SAME FORMULA FOR ALL ROWS 1 through lastRow
  const rowsFromBack = totalRows - row;
  const reductionPairs = Math.floor(rowsFromBack / 2);
  const seatsRemoved = reductionPairs * 2;
  const calculatedSeats = 50 - seatsRemoved;
  return Math.max(
    calculatedSeats % 2 === 0 ? calculatedSeats : calculatedSeats - 1,
    10
  );
};
```

### Seat Allocation (Simplified):

```typescript
// Row 1: VIP
if (row === 1) { ... }

// Row 2: Guests
else if (row === 2) { ... }

// Rows 3-4: Faculty (exactly 65)
else if (row >= 3 && row <= 4 && facultyCounter <= 65) { ... }

// Rows 5-7: Parents (exactly 100)
else if (row >= 5 && row <= 7 && parentsCounter <= 100) { ... }

// Rows 8-13: Degree Students (all seats)
else if (row >= 8 && row <= 13) { ... }

// Rows 14+: College Students (exactly 600)
else if (row >= 14 && studentCounter <= 600) { ... }
```
