# CSV Hydration Fix - Booked Seats Not Showing

## Problem

The booked seats were not showing as occupied in the UI. When clicking on a seat that should be booked, it showed "assign user" option instead of displaying the seat as already occupied.

## Root Cause

The CSV files (`users.csv` and `booked_seats.csv`) use **string IDs** like "D1", "D2", "C1", "C2", etc., but the TypeScript code was expecting **numeric IDs**.

The code was trying to parse these string IDs as integers:

- `parseInt("D1")` returns `NaN` (Not a Number)
- `parseInt("C1")` returns `NaN`

This caused the hydration process to fail silently because:

1. User IDs couldn't be matched (all parsed as NaN)
2. Seats couldn't be linked to users
3. Seat status remained "available" instead of being set to "booked"

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/types/index.ts`

Changed ID types from `number` to `string`:

- `User.id`: `number` → `string`
- `SeatAssignment.userId`: `number` → `string`
- `BookedSeatRecord.userId`: `number` → `string`

### 2. `src/utils/index.ts`

Removed integer parsing for IDs:

- `parseCSVData()`: Removed `parseInt()` transform for `id` field
- `parseBookedSeatsData()`: Removed `parseInt()` transform for `userId` field
- Updated filter from `!Number.isNaN(record.userId)` to `Boolean(record.userId)`

### 3. `src/App.tsx`

- Updated `handleAssignSeat()`: `userId: number` → `userId: string`
- Updated `handleBookedSaveFromViewer()`: `userId: number | null` → `userId: string | null`
- Added comprehensive console logging to track hydration process

### 4. `src/components/SeatModal.tsx`

- Updated `onAssign` prop: `userId: number` → `userId: string`
- Updated state: `useState<number | null>` → `useState<string | null>`

### 5. `src/components/DataViewer.tsx`

- Updated `BookedRecord.userId`: `number | null` → `string | null`

## Debugging Added

Added console logging to track the hydration process:

- ✅ Number of users loaded from CSV
- ✅ Number of booked seats loaded from CSV
- ✅ Total seats generated
- ✅ Successfully matched booked seats count
- ❌ Failed matches with details

## Expected Output

When you refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh), you should see in the console:

```
🔄 Starting CSV hydration...
✅ Loaded 534 users from CSV
✅ Loaded 534 booked seats from CSV
✅ Generated 1042 total seats
📊 User map size: 534
📊 Seat map size: 1042
✅ Successfully matched 534 booked seats
❌ Failed to match 0 booked seats
```

## Testing

1. **Hard refresh the browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check the console logs to see hydration progress
4. Click on seats D1-D196 (Degree Students) - should show as booked
5. Click on seats 1-338 (College Students) - should show as booked
6. Booked seats should display in darker colors:
   - Degree: Darker green (green-600/800)
   - College: Darker cyan (cyan-600/800)

## Data Format

**CSV Format (correct):**

```csv
# users.csv
id,seatNumber,name,email,phone,category
D1,D1,PARAM TAIMNI,paramtaimni41@gmail.com,8279140515,Degree Students
C1,1,Anurag 5,anurag.btech2023@spsu.ac.in,9352940030,College Students

# booked_seats.csv
category,seatNumber,userId,userName,email,phone,notes
Degree Students,D1,D1,PARAM TAIMNI,paramtaimni41@gmail.com,8279140515,23MBA00348 | Master of Business Administration
College Students,1,C1,Anurag 5,anurag.btech2023@spsu.ac.in,9352940030,B.tech - 23me002781
```

## Verification

Total booked seats: **534**

- Degree Students: 196 (D1-D196)
- College Students: 338 (1-338)

All 534 seats should now display as booked in the UI with darker colors.
