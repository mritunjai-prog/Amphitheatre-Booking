# Row 13 Fix - Degree Students Only

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed: Row 13 Had College Students

### Problem:

- **Row 13** had 4 College Student seats (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4)
- This was confusing and broke the category separation
- Degree Students should completely fill rows 8-13
- College Students should start from row 14 onwards

### Solution:

**Hardcoded row boundaries for Degree and College Students:**

- **Rows 8-13**: ALL seats = Degree Students (D1, D2, D3, ...)
- **Rows 14+**: ALL seats = College Students (1, 2, 3, ...)

## ‚ú® What Changed

### Before (Problematic):

```
Row 12: D157, D158, ..., D198 (42 Degree Students)
Row 13: D199, D200, 1, 2, 3, 4 (2 Degree + 4 College) ‚ùå MIXED
Row 14: 5, 6, 7, ... (College Students continuing)
```

### After (Fixed):

```
Row 12: D157, D158, ..., D198 (42 Degree Students)
Row 13: D199, D200, ..., D240 (42 Degree Students ONLY) ‚úÖ FIXED
Row 14: 1, 2, 3, ..., 44 (College Students START HERE) ‚úÖ CLEAN
Row 15: 45, 46, 47, ... (College Students continuing)
```

---

## üéØ Key Changes in Code

### 1. Fixed Row Boundary:

```typescript
// OLD: Dynamic calculation based on 200 seat limit
let lastDegreeRow = firstStudentRow;
for (let r = firstStudentRow; r <= lastStudentRow; r++) {
  if (degreeSeatsPlaced + seatsInRow <= 200) {
    lastDegreeRow = r;
  }
}

// NEW: Hardcoded to row 13
const lastDegreeRow = 13; // Degree Students end at row 13
```

### 2. Updated Seat Generation:

```typescript
// OLD: Used counters and maxDegree limit
else if (row >= 8 && degreeCounter <= maxDegree) {
  seatNumber = `D${degreeCounter++}`;
  category = "Degree Students";
}

// NEW: Based purely on row number
else if (row >= 8 && row <= 13) {
  seatNumber = `D${degreeCounter++}`;
  category = "Degree Students";
}
else if (row >= 14 && studentCounter <= maxStudents) {
  seatNumber = `${studentCounter++}`;
  category = "College Students";
}
```

### 3. Removed Unused Variable:

```typescript
// Removed: const maxDegree = 200;
// No longer needed since we use row-based allocation
```

## ‚úÖ Results

1. **Row 13 is now ALL Degree Students** ‚úÖ
2. **No College Students in row 13** ‚úÖ
3. **College Students start cleanly from row 14** ‚úÖ
4. **Total Degree Students**: ~240 (increased from 200)
5. **Total College Students**: Still 600 (unchanged limit)
6. **Clean category separation** ‚úÖ
